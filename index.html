      <p>A crappy guide to playing Potemkin in Guilty Gear Strive</p>

      <p>Potemkin is Guilty Gear Strive's best (and only) <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Grappler">grappler</a>. He takes up half the screen and deals big damage, so what's not to love? If your goal is to win with as few button presses as possible and in as stupid a way as possible, then you're in the right place.</p>

      <p>Hi! My name's Camden, and I made this site as an example for a <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> workshop! I like programming, art, and video games (whenever I can find the time for them).</p>
      <p>I got into Guilty Gear with Strive about a year or two ago, but I've also played a little bit of <em>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core +R</em> (try saying that five times fast). I admittedly spend a lot more time <em>thinking</em> about Guilty Gear than actually playing it since I tend to say busy, but even then I think about it <b>a lot.</b></p>
      <p>I play Potemkin because he's really big and I think that Potemkin Buster is the funniest thing to happen since Seinfeld started questioning airline food.</p>
      <p>You can find me <a href="https://hackclub.com/slack/">on Hack Club's Slack</a> under @Camguy</p>
