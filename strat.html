      <p>A big part of playing Potemkin is getting hard knockdowns in order to threaten Potemkin Buster. This tends to looks like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stunning or knocking down the opponent with moves like Slide Head or Garuda Impact</li>
        <li><a href="dist.html">Closing the distance</a>, if necessary</li>
        <li>Going for either Pot Buster or a <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Meaty#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20definition%20of,(like%20a%20dragon%20punch).">meaty attack</a></li>
        <li>Knock the opponent down again, either with Pot Buster or at the end of a combo</li>
        <li>Closing the distance with Hammer Fall while they're down and repeating the 50/50</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This cycle of getting a knockdown and forcing the opponent into a 50/50 between a meaty and Pot Buster is what Potemkin <i>usually</i> does during his turn, <b>though parts of the enemy's kit (like DP moves) can complicate this.</b> At his most basic, however, this is what Pot does.</p>

      <h2>TO BUST, OR NOT TO BUST?</h2>
      <p>When you do have your opponent in a knockdown, you have to choose whether to go for a Pot Buster or a meaty, and you have to choose quickly. But which should you choose? <strong>It depends on what your opponent is doing.</strong></p>

      <p>You have to try and get inside your opponent's head to try and make them do what you want them to do. If you keep trying to Pot Bust, for example, but the opponent keeps mashing to catch you in the middle of the animation, you could choose to go for meaty attacks instead for a while and avoid using Pot Buster. Eventually your opponent will notice that their mashing isn't working anymore, and start blocking. Now, when you finally go for Pot Buster again, it'll connect because they're expecting you to go for a meaty. This is called <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Conditioning">Conditioning</a>, and getting good at conditioning your opponent is key to winning more of your 50/50s.</p>
